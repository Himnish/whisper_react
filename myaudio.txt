The motion page is designed to display the user's face based on the image they have taken in the previous page
and helps them decide whether they want to continue building a playlist from the mode generator
or if they want to retake their photograph.
The interaction of this page with other components is into the form of buttons
which will either take the user back to the camera page if they want to retake the photograph
or it moves them onto the playlist generation page where the playlist is custom generated based on the mode.
The languages and libraries that we use to build this page were mainly dots and flutter.
