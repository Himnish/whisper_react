00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
The motion page is designed to display the user's face based on the image they have taken in the previous page

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
and helps them decide whether they want to continue building a playlist from the mode generator

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
or if they want to retake their photograph.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
The interaction of this page with other components is into the form of buttons

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
which will either take the user back to the camera page if they want to retake the photograph

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
or it moves them onto the playlist generation page where the playlist is custom generated based on the mode.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
The languages and libraries that we use to build this page were mainly dots and flutter.
